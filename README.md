This is my first time touching web-development. Although I like to say that I am coming from a background of coding, I WAS NOT GOOD AT ALL, But these are langauges i've 'learnt' before doing webdevelopment: python (I made tts programs to help me read webnovels), C++ (I made game hacks for minecraft), Java (I have done a bit of skidding to make a server-plugin for my SMP), and finally Lua (I've made roblox games, or atleast, tried to, since I was like 10 years old.) Note that, except maybe for Lua, I am begginer level in all langauges: Python, C++ and Java.

I plan to document every project I have from now on like this.

Resources:
1) Basics of html and css in freecodecamp (I only did three lessons)
2) Youtube: I try not to binge watch tutorials so I only watched a 35 minute crash-course for express js by Web Dev Simplified on youtube. (hes goated if you already know other langauges and understand programming basics)

About the project:
1) This project is a simple forum page where you can order some food to our resturant (doesn't work btw, call our resturant if you need an actual order)
2) The orders will be shown in the kitchen. To enter the kitchen, enter the password: password123. You can delete orders and also finish them. 
3) Also the UI is terrible. :sob:
4) You can test it out in this website: https://order-system-tlt2.onrender.com/ (Opening takes a lot of time, probably because its a free service)

What I learnt in this project: 
1) Basics of express.
2) Routes and dynamic routes.
3) Basics of mongodb using mongoose.
